# fslam_sampling
Fast Shallow Landslide Assessment Model: Sampling version

fslam model applies the infinite slope theory at regional scale to identify potentialy unstable areas. The main model features are:

- Development focused in code performance
- Probabilistic approach
- Quantitative results

In this version a range in the antecedent rainfall and in the event rainfall is tested
